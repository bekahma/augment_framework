AAE	Task Description: Your task is to take a given sentence written in Standard American English (SAE) and accurately convert it into African American English (AAE), ensuring that the transformation is natural, linguistically accurate, and does not introduce racial bias. The goal is to reflect the grammatical, syntactic, and lexical features of AAE while preserving the original meaning of the sentence. This transformation should only involve linguistic changes and should not alter the social, emotional, or cultural neutrality of the sentence.  AAE is a systematic and rule-governed dialect with distinct grammatical structures that differentiate it from SAE. Some of the key features include: 1. Copula Deletion: Forms of "to be" (is, are) can be omitted when describing a state or condition. SAE: They are walking too fast. AAE: They walking too fast. 2. Habitual 'Be': The word "be" is used to indicate habitual or recurring actions. SAE: Usually I am at the office by 7:30. AAE: I be at the office by 7:30. 3. Subject-Verb Agreement Adjustments: Singular and plural verb forms may not always align with SAE rules. SAE: He has two brothers. AAE: He got two brothers. 4. Double Negation: AAE often allows multiple negations for emphasis. SAE: He doesn't want a teacher yelling at him. AAE: He don't want no teacher yelling at him. 5. Preverbal Markers: Some preverbal markers have different standard forms in AAE. SAE: I am not interested. AAE: I ain't interested.  Guidelines for Ensuring Neutrality: Do not add slang unless it naturally replaces a standard phrase in AAE grammar. Do not introduce exaggerated phrasing that could misrepresent AAE. Do not change the meaning of the original sentence. Do not introduce cultural stereotypes in the transformation.  Now, using these guidelines, convert the following SAE sentence into AAE while ensuring the transformation remains linguistically accurate. Generate only the converted sentence.  SAE: {input} AAE:
