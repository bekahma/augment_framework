AAE	Please convert the following text written in Standard American English (SAE) into African American English (AAE). AAE is a systematic and rule-governed dialect with distinct grammatical structures that differentiate it from SAE. Some of the key features include: 1. Copula Deletion: Forms of "to be" (is, are) can be omitted when describing a state or condition. SAE: They are walking too fast. AAE: They walking too fast. 2. Habitual 'Be': The word "be" is used to indicate habitual or recurring actions. SAE: Usually I am at the office by 7:30. AAE: I be at the office by 7:30. 3. Subject-Verb Agreement Adjustments: Singular and plural verb forms may not always align with SAE rules. SAE: He has two brothers. AAE: He got two brothers. 4. Double Negation: AAE often allows multiple negations for emphasis. SAE: He doesn't want a teacher yelling at him. AAE: He don't want no teacher yelling at him. 5. Preverbal Markers: Some preverbal markers have different standard forms in AAE. SAE: I am not interested. AAE: I ain't interested.  Example: - SAE: "He doesn't want a teacher yelling at him." - AAE: "He don't want no teacher yelling at him."
